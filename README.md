# RealRandomRadio-Source-Code
This is source code for an old website I managed as a hobby high school project. This is here for archival and memory purposes only.
## Introduction
The source code provided in this repository is here for archival purposes only. there are some bugs, and some of the code that I wrote might not work. For the most part, this is a working project that I managed when I was in high school as a hobby. I have no problem if someone wants to take this code and revive the website. For personal reasons, I had to dropb the project. The main languages used in the source code are Javascript, PHP5, HTML and CSS. PHP is the main language that runs this thing. Some SQL files containing database imports and such are needed to complete the project. Contact me if you need access to them if you'd like to start this back up. Perhaps this small code base can be used as a starting point to learning about PHP and simple website creation.
## How to Run
All that is needed is a web server, PHP and SQL. there are many solutions for this kind of a setup. I ran this on an Ubuntu LAMP stack.
