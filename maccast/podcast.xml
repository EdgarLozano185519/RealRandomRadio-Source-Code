<description>
In this very short episode of Mac Cast, we demonstrate one thing and one thing only.
Anthony gives us a demonstration of Garage Band, a program for the Mac that will do a lot with sound!
Listen as he gives us an overview of one of its more entertaining features, a variety of effects that can be applied to sound.
Quite entertaining for a short episode.

<description>In this episode, Anthony gives us an update of the RealRandomRadio website and mentions a switch over from our current web host onto a linode that he had purchased. This, however, is not necessarily true.
The only thing that we really did was purchase a domain that we could use to easily connect to some of the servers that we have set up.
Also, yours truly, makes an appearance on the show and talks about some of the other features of the site so far.
We demonstrate some of the edited episodes of the Mac Cast Podcast, and talk about other things that relate to the Macintosh.

<title>Mac Cast for January 30, 2012</title>
<link>http://forum.realrandomradio.com/viewtopic.php?id=8</link>
<description>In this podcast, there is a lot of side conversation, along with technical problems and adjustments. These guys are beginners, so you might want to give them a break. There is also some discussion over the various types of IPhones and their capabilities. Anthony also gives us an update on the site, and gives us a short demonstration on how it functions. That was a while back, which means that the site could have changed since then. I also give a brief introduction of the Mac Cast episode in which I tell you of ways that you can contact me. This and more to come for this episode! Enjoy this entertaining podcast, with some sense of humor.</description>
