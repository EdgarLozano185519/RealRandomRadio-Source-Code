<h1>Mac Cast episodes</h1>
<h2>Mac Cast for March 19, 2012</h2>
<p>
In this very short episode of Mac Cast, we demonstrate one thing and one thing only.<br>
Anthony gives us a demonstration of Garage Band, a program for the Mac that will do a lot with sound!<br>
Listen as he gives us an overview of one of its more entertaining features, a variety of effects that can be applied to sound.<br>
Quite entertaining for a short episode.<br>

<h2>Mac Cast for March 5, 2012</h2>
<p>
In this episode, Anthony gives us an update of the RealRandomRadio website and mentions a switch over from our current web host onto a linode that he had purchased.<br>
This, however, is not necessarily true.<br>
The only thing that we really did was purchase a domain that we could use to easily connect to some of the servers that we have set up.<br>
Also, yours truly, makes an appearance on the show and talks about some of the other features of the site so far.<br>
We demonstrate some of the edited episodes of the Mac Cast Podcast, and talk about other things that relate to the Macintosh.<br>

<h2>Mac Cast for February 6, 2012</h2>
<p>
In this podcast, our Mac Cast crew goofs off and they tend to steer away from the topic of which they were going to cover.<br>
Check them out as they entertain you with a variety of randomness, and possibly interesting information regarding software for Macintosh.<br>
They give you a couple of Mac tips, and the crew tries to find a combination of variety of intros so that they can use them for openings.<br>
Expect humor and more from this episode.<br>

<h2>Mac Cast for January 30, 2012</h2>
<p>
In this podcast, there is a lot of side conversation, along with technical problems and adjustments.<br>
These guys are beginners, so you might want to give them a break.<br>
There is also some discussion over the various types of IPhones and their capabilities.<br>
Anthony also gives us an update on the site, and gives us a short demonstration on how it functions.<br>
That was a while back, which means that the site could have changed since then.<br>
I also give a brief introduction of the Mac Cast episode in which I tell you of ways that you can contact me.<br>
This and more to come for this episode!<br>
Enjoy this entertaining podcast, with some sense of humor.</p>
