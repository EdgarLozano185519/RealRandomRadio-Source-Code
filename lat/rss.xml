<title>LAT Episode 1 - The Beginning</title>
<link>http://forum.realrandomradio.com/viewtopic.php?id=21</link>
<description>
In this new series, known as LAT (Life at TSBVI), we will be taking some adventures through the school, and reviewing a couple of activities there.
TSBVI is Texas School for the Blind and Visually Impaired, and its an interesting life to be there.
Anyway, in this first episode, we will be doing a couple of things.
We start off with an introduction and walking toward the Recreation Center.
Once there, we decide to demonstrate two of the games that are quite entertaining.
Lastly, we decide to take a detour, and walk to the school's Main Building to see what adventures lie throughout this walk.
I hope that this will be a successful series, and we encourage you to listen!

Here we are again with another LAT episode.
In this third one, we attend a weekly event known as Quiz Night.
Quiz Night consists of a competitive time of answering questions.
In this episode, we go through two different competitive games: Family Feud, and 20 Questions.
You will notice a slight change in the way the questions are asked and answered.
For example, the first question given is a 20 questions question.
Can you figure out which is which?
Listen in for some short, but assured, entertainment.
